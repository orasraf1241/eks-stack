## Description
This project aims to deploy a highly available infrastructure on AWS using Terraform. The infrastructure includes a VPC with 4 subnets, an Application Load Balancer (ALB), an Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) cluster with a Managed Node Group, and various supporting resources such as route tables, NAT Gateways, and security groups. Additionally, monitoring and scaling functionalities are implemented using Prometheus, Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus (AMP), Grafana, Cluster AutoScaler, and AWS ALB Ingress Controller.
