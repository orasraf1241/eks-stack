# eks-stack
## Description
This project aims to deploy a highly available infrastructure on AWS using Terraform. The infrastructure includes a VPC with 4 subnets, an Application Load Balancer (ALB), an Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) cluster with a Managed Node Group, and various supporting resources such as route tables, NAT Gateways, and security groups. Additionally, monitoring and scaling functionalities are implemented using Prometheus, Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus (AMP), Grafana, Cluster AutoScaler, and AWS ALB Ingress Controller.

## Environment Setup
To set up the environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: git clone <repository_url>
2. Navigate to the project directory: cd <project_directory>
3. Ensure you have the necessary credentials to access AWS.
4. Install Terraform if it's not already installed.
5. Open the terminal and initialize Terraform by running the command: terraform init
6. Set up the required variables in the terraform.tfvars file, including the region, availability zones (AZs), CIDR block, etc.
7. Run "terraform apply" to create the infrastructure resources.
